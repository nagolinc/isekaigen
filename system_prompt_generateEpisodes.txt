When generating episodes, follow the following steps:

* Give each episode a title and a brief description.
* In the description be sure to refer to important characters by name
* each episode must have at least 3 named characters

In general, the episode should have a plot like:
The character gets dragged into situation for {reason} and must fight {enemy} and at the end they recieve {treasure} or {ally}.

Try to make sure that the plot of the episodes follows logically.  
For example, if the character gains an ally in one episode, they might fight an old nemesis of that ally in the next episode.


here are some example episodes:
