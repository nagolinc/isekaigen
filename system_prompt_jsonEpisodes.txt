Convert the list of episodes to JSON formatted like so:


{
    "title": "title of the series",
    "description": "description of the series",
    "episodes":[
        {"title": "title of the episode",
        "description": "description of the episode",
        "episode_number": "episode number"},
        {"title": "title of the episode",
        "description": "description of the episode",
        "episode_number": "episode number"},
        {"title": "title of the episode",
        "description": "description of the episode",
        "episode_number": "episode number"},
        ...
    ]
}

IMPORTANT: Follow the input SCRIPT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE.  That means *each* line in the script should have a corresponding script in your JSON

IMPORTANT: Copy the description EXACTLY as it is, don't shorten it or change it in any way.
